# Climb
A pure javascript, no library made from scratch html5 game. This game was my way of learning game development from a ground up approach. I had to learn to how to mathematically build geometries, develop gravity and use creative development to supplement a video game framework. Hopefully you can use this project as an example on how to make video game elements for the web.

## How to play.

>**Space** - Jump to other side

>**Double Tap Space** - Jump in to the middle of the screen and fall back down to the original side of the game. 


Don't fall through the walls and climb as high as you can!


This game is NOT complete and will be revisited in the future.
